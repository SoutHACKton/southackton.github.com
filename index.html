<p>This event is hosted by <a href="http://29thsouthamptonscouts.org/">29th Southampton Scout Group</a>, all
donations will be passed on to the Scout Group to cover hall hire fees.</p>

<h3>Facilities</h3>

<p>There is no <strong>internet</strong> connection at the Scout Hut, but 3G internet is
available.
<strong>Soldering</strong> is allowed, but will be restricted to a couple of tables to
prevent the spread of damage. Tables, chairs and <strong>electricity</strong> will be
available, but you should bring anything else you&#8217;ll need (laptops,
components, soldering irons). We encourage our members to <strong>share
resources</strong> with other members, so if you don&#8217;t have something (e.g. a
soldering iron) then don&#8217;t worry - I&#8217;m sure someone will let you use
theirs.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and biscuits will be available, but you&#8217;ll need to sort out
your own lunch.</p>

To help us gather data for an upcoming meeting with
<a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/">Southampton University</a> to discuss their potential
support for a Southampton-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" title="a location where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital or electronic art (but also in many other realms) can meet, socialise and/or collaborate">hackerspace</a> (a.k.a. makerspace,
creative space - see excerpt below), we&#8217;ve created a brief <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/southackton.org.uk/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDNqNFNCNE9jZllBZmpaY2xwZ2NHQnc6MQ" title="2012 SoutHACKton Survey">survey</a>.  It&#8217;s short and to the point - it
should only take you three minutes to fill out -
but even if you only answer the first two questions (around 15 seconds)
that will help us tremendously!

Andy will illustrate this &#8220;smarter planet&#8221; vision<br/>with features of his home automation system, including monitoring<br/>power consumption and water usage, remote control of electrical<br/>appliances from his mobile phone, and his electronic mouse traps! He<br/>will describe other applications of this technology, including vehicle<br/>telematics and the intriguing world of &#8220;tweetjects&#8221; - objects that<br/>Twitter.</p><p>Professor Andy Stanford-Clark is the Chief Technologist for IBM&#8217;s<br/>consulting business in Energy and Utilities for the UK and Ireland. He<br/>is an IBM Distinguished Engineer, and &#8220;Master Inventor&#8221; with more than<br/>40 patents. Andy is based at IBM&#8217;s Hursley Park laboratories in the<br/>UK, and specialises in remote telemetry, energy monitoring and<br/>management, Smart Metering and Smart Grid technologies. He has a<br/>particular interest in home energy monitoring, home automation,<br/>demand-side management, and driving consumer behaviour change.  Andy<br/>has a BSc in Computing and Mathematics, and a PhD in Computer Science.<br/>He is a visiting professor at the University of Newcastle and a Fellow<br/>of the British Computer Society. &#8221;</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to Paul Stimpson on the Surrey LUG mailing list for pointing the
course out:</p>

<blockquote><p>MIT are launching the first course in their new e-learning programme
designed to bring education free to the masses. It&#8217;s a course in
electronic circuits and design and begins on March 5th. This is a
trial and at this stage does not require any attendance or for proof
of identity to be shown. It is examined online and results in an
MIT-branded certificate for successful students. The only obligations
are to complete the course and exams in the time frame specified and
to agree to the University honour code (not to cheat).</p>

<p>The course runs
for 13 weeks (March 5th until June 8th) and requires a time investment
of approximately 10 hours per week.</p>

<p>You can register at

  members can share skills and tools to allow people of all abilities to create
  something amazing, regardless of experience, whether it be: craft,
