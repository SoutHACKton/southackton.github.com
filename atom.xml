    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last weekend the So Make It workshop acquired a lathe! Peter Bond was kind enough to sell us an old but reliable metalworking lathe for a very reasonable price and it was installed and commissioned last Sunday.</p>

<p><img src="http://SoutHACKton.github.com/images/lathe.jpg" alt="lathe" /></p>

<p>Anybody who know how to use a lathe (training will be available) can of course go ahead and do so but before doing so please familiarize yourself with the wiki page.</p>

<p>Details are going to be kept on our tooling section on the wiki here:
<a href="https://wiki.somakeit.org.uk/wiki/Lathe">https://wiki.somakeit.org.uk/wiki/Lathe</a></p>

<p>Please keep the page updated, listing design quirks and operational guidance there. There are a number of upgrades and projects considered too - please let us know if you&#8217;re interested in helping.</p>

<p>As mentioned on the page, safety is critical so please read this page before use. It is also reapeated here:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is no guard currently so full PPE should be worn when operating or being near the lathe. This includes safety goggles and apron.</li>
<li>Obviously all jewellery must be removed, long hair tied back and baggy clothing removed when operating the lathe.</li>
<li>The lathe bench must remain clear and tidy at all times.</li>
<li>The chuck key must be removed when operating the lathe - it can travel at such speeds as to KILL if left in the chuck.</li>
</ol>

    <id>http://SoutHACKton.github.com/2013/03/28/regular-access</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that we have a space, we want to open it up for everyone to come and play. Unfortunately we are unable to give everyone a key, so we have to try and fit the schedules of both our members and the keyholders. We currently have 5 keyholders - <a href="http://www.somakeit.org.uk/trustees/">our trustees</a>.</p>

<p>To help us guage when you wanted to come we ran a poll; the results are as follows:<br/>
<img src="http://SoutHACKton.github.com/images/2013-03-access-times-survey-results.png" alt="poll results" /></p>

<p>We analysed these results, reconciled them with keyholder availability, and are happy to announce that we can commit to having the space open the following times each week:</p>

<h3>Opening Hours</h3>

<p>From Tuesday 2nd April (we are closed Easter weekend)<br/>
Tuesdays: 7.30pm - 10.30pm <br/>
Saturdays: 2pm - 8pm</p>

<p>Our aim is to always have someone available during these times, every week. <em>(We may not be open on some public holidays - it&#8217;s probably worth checking if you&#8217;re unsure.)</em></p>

<h3>Ad-Hoc access</h3>

<p>Of course we will also be opening the space for ad-hoc openings or special access times. We want to build something to help coordinate/organise this (volunteers needed - get in touch!) but in the mean time you can pop onto <a href="https://wiki.somakeit.org.uk/wiki/IRC">IRC</a> and ask a trustee (they generally have operator status); or send a message to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton">the mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>When the space is (going to be) open we&#8217;ll try and remember to tweet out (on <a href="http://twitter.com/MakeSoton">@MakeSoton</a> - the So Make It twitter account) or post to the mailing list. If you notice we haven&#8217;t done so, please inform someone so that it can be rectified.</p>

<p>We hope to see you all regularly!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that we have a space, we intend to open it up more regularly. As we have 5 keyholders we are limited to the amount of time we can open, so we want to make sure we are open when it suits you the most.</p>

<p>To that end, you can <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/XVBLT6S">help by filling out a survey</a> to show what days and times you would regularly use the space.</p>

<p>Once we have the results of the survey, the <a href="http://www.somakeit.org.uk/trustees/">trustees</a> will work out when we should be opening the most. We are intending to have the same slot(s) each week, to keep things simple.</p>

    <id>http://SoutHACKton.github.com/2012/09/28/september-meetup-summary</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night around 20 SoutHACKtoners met up at <a href="http://www.thearthousesouthampton.co.uk/">The Arthouse</a>
in Southampton to discuss hacking, making and various other topics.</p>

<p><img src="http://SoutHACKton.github.com/images/sept2012.jpg" title="SoutHACKton members at the Arthouse" ></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>3D printing was a hot topic. There was much talk over what various CAD
software, slice software, printer firmware and drivers were being used.
There are a number of members who have 3D printers now, and even better
one of our members turned up and handed another member the 3D printed
pieces required to build his own 3D printer; the printing of these parts
took 40 hours! The discussion depicted below focuses on how to deal with
holes in 3D printed objects coming out smaller than in the CAD plan.</p>

<p><img src="http://SoutHACKton.github.com/images/sept2012-3dp.jpg" title="SoutHACKton members discuss 3D printing" ></p>

<p>One member brought a work-in-progress wheeled robot, making it clear
which table was the SoutHACKton one, and soliciting interest from other
Arthouse attendees! There was a demo of it going backwards and forwards
at various speeds (turning was not working quite so well!) and its
working was explained to anyone who was interested. Robot related
discussions included the viability of using a 12V cigarette lighter USB
charger as a voltage regulator from a 7.4V battery supply, potential
ways to improve the steering, the negatives of running two motors in
series, Lithium-Ion batteries and their massive ability to supply
current (300A burst), and motor driver boards.</p>

<p><img src="http://SoutHACKton.github.com/images/sept2012-robot.jpg" title="A robot developed by a SoHa member" ></p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://SoutHACKton.github.com/images/euler.jpg" title="Leonhard Euler (source: Wikipedia)" ></p>

<p>Some other members were discussing more software related items,
including: the creation of a social network designed to help people find
other people who share their interests to help them with their hacking
projects; a work-in-progress game engine for a multiplayer JRPG
(Japanese-style Role Playing Game) which has evolved from a number of
spreadsheets to a system written in JavaScript; and the possibility of
running a <a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> event, whereby members can come and attempt
the Project Euler problems in a programming language of their choice,
where others can help them to solve the problem, or to code the
solution.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://SoutHACKton.github.com/images/sept2012-touchswitch.jpg" title="A touch-sensitive switch" ></p>

<p>Home automation was discussed - one member has a system set up whereby
depending on the order his doormat and door sensors were triggered, and
the outside temperature, it puts the kettle on when you enter the
property on a cold day. Using capacitive touch for automated light
switches was discussed, with two members pleased to find each other -
apparently the only two people out of the group to have had capacitive
touch light switches as children. One major issue of these switches was
discussed - that of terrified toddlers during thunderstorms, where the
electro-magnetic pulses could trigger the light switch randomly during a
storm!</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://SoutHACKton.github.com/images/sept2012-bump.jpg" title="A baby bump with a foot pushing outwards" ></p>

<p>Other topics included the recent meeting with Southampton University,
concerns with security when setting up a hackerspace, needlework, and
the viability of creating a t-shirt capable of displaying where an
unborn baby was kicking. Various methods for this were discussed,
including electrodes, flex sensors, ultrasound and repurposing of a
chest strap pulse rate monitor. It was suggested that this might be of
particular interest to our friends over at <a href="http://www.mztek.org/">MzTEK</a>.</p>

<p>It was a great evening and many are looking forward to joining us at the
<a href="http://southackton.org.uk/2012/09/19/hack-day/">Hack day</a> in October. If you have any stories or photos you wish to
share, or feedback, please post it straight into <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/southackton/ipue2xL3zXw">this thread</a>
(or you can email it to benjie at soha.org.uk).</p>

<p><strong>Next event</strong>: <a href="http://southackton.org.uk/2012/09/19/hack-day/">Hack day</a>, Sunday 14th October 10:30am-4:30pm.</p>

<p><strong>Next meetup</strong>: Thursday 25th October, 7:30pm at <a href="http://www.thearthousesouthampton.co.uk/">the Arthouse</a>.</p>

<p>This event is hosted by <a href="http://29thsouthamptonscouts.org/">29th Southampton Scout Group</a>, all
donations will be passed on to the Scout Group to cover hall hire fees.</p>

<h3>Facilities</h3>

<p>There is no <strong>internet</strong> connection at the Scout Hut, but 3G internet is
available.
<strong>Soldering</strong> is allowed, but will be restricted to a couple of tables to
prevent the spread of damage. Tables, chairs and <strong>electricity</strong> will be
available, but you should bring anything else you&#8217;ll need (laptops,
components, soldering irons). We encourage our members to <strong>share
resources</strong> with other members, so if you don&#8217;t have something (e.g. a
soldering iron) then don&#8217;t worry - I&#8217;m sure someone will let you use
theirs.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and biscuits will be available, but you&#8217;ll need to sort out
your own lunch.</p>

<h3>What is a Hack Day?</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>It&#8217;s a day where people can bring along their current projects (if any)
and can work on them in the presence of other like-minded individuals.
Others can have a look around, gain inspiration or offer a helping hand,
or just have fun!</p>

<p>Are you just starting out with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="Arduino">Arduino</a>/<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Raspberry Pi mini computer">Raspberry Pi</a>?
Putting the finishing touches on your latest life-size robot? Planning
to build a water jet-pack? Hacking electronics into clothing? Hacking
together the components necessary to make a new GNU/Linux distro or
media centre software? Join us!</p>

<h3>What if I don&#8217;t have a current project?</h3>

<p>Come along anyway - help with someone else&#8217;s, or get ideas for what you
could do! Skilled or unskilled, knowledgeable or not-so-knowledgeable,
all are welcome!</p>

<h3>Where do I sign up? What projects are going on there?</h3>

<p>All you need to do is turn up, but the more people that come the merrier
- so let people know you are coming on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton" title="SoutHACKton Google Group">mailing list</a>,
and if you&#8217;re planning on bringing a project with you then let us know
what it is!</p>

To help us gather data for an upcoming meeting with
<a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/">Southampton University</a> to discuss their potential
support for a Southampton-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" title="a location where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital or electronic art (but also in many other realms) can meet, socialise and/or collaborate">hackerspace</a> (a.k.a. makerspace,
creative space - see excerpt below), we&#8217;ve created a brief <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/southackton.org.uk/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDNqNFNCNE9jZllBZmpaY2xwZ2NHQnc6MQ" title="2012 SoutHACKton Survey">survey</a>.  It&#8217;s short and to the point - it
should only take you three minutes to fill out -
but even if you only answer the first two questions (around 15 seconds)
that will help us tremendously!

<p>The hackerspaces.org <a href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces">List of Hacker Spaces</a>
map shows that Southampton is perfectly positioned to host a location
for makers, hackers and tinkerers from a wide area to meet and collaborate.</p>

<blockquote><p>A hackerspace or hackspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace or creative space) is a location where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital or electronic art (but also in many other realms) can meet, socialise and/or collaborate. Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops, workshops and/or studios where hackers can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things.</p><p>Many hackerspaces participate in the use and development of free software, open hardware, and alternative media. They are often physically located in infoshops, social centers, adult education centers, or on university campuses, but may relocate to industrial or warehouse space when they need more room.</p><footer><strong>Wikipedia</strong> <cite><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace'>Hackerspace</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Results of the survey will be aggregated and announced at a later date.</p>

Andy will illustrate this &#8220;smarter planet&#8221; vision<br/>with features of his home automation system, including monitoring<br/>power consumption and water usage, remote control of electrical<br/>appliances from his mobile phone, and his electronic mouse traps! He<br/>will describe other applications of this technology, including vehicle<br/>telematics and the intriguing world of &#8220;tweetjects&#8221; - objects that<br/>Twitter.</p><p>Professor Andy Stanford-Clark is the Chief Technologist for IBM&#8217;s<br/>consulting business in Energy and Utilities for the UK and Ireland.
