    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to Paul Stimpson on the Surrey LUG mailing list for pointing the
course out:</p>

<blockquote><p>MIT are launching the first course in their new e-learning programme
designed to bring education free to the masses. It&#8217;s a course in
electronic circuits and design and begins on March 5th. This is a
trial and at this stage does not require any attendance or for proof
of identity to be shown. It is examined online and results in an
MIT-branded certificate for successful students. The only obligations
are to complete the course and exams in the time frame specified and
to agree to the University honour code (not to cheat).</p>

<p>The course runs
for 13 weeks (March 5th until June 8th) and requires a time investment
of approximately 10 hours per week.</p>

<p>You can register at
<a href="https://6002x.mitx.mit.edu/">https://6002x.mitx.mit.edu/</a></p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to SoutHACKton, the Southampton Hackerspace project.</p>

<p>We are a
community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to share skills
and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing, regardless of
experience. We want to start a Hackerspace in Southampton, where people
can come to work on their various projects and can get the resources
they need and can share knowledge and ideas. If you always wanted to
make something but don&#8217;t know how then our members will be more than
happy to help you.</p>

<p>We have regular meetings of people who enjoy creating
or modifying software and/or hardware and want to meet other like-minded
people. Experience is unnecessary - interest is all we require! Topics
that we’re already interested in include: home automation/augmentation,
robotics, circuit bends, programming, computer interfaces, wiimote
hacking, Arduino, gadgets, mobile computing, PVR creation/improvement,
programming, augmented reality, … so if you’re interested in any of
these topics, or have another interest you want to share, why not join
us?</p>

<p>For more details, including a map to our usual meetup place, see
<a href="http://SoutHACKton.github.com/about">about</a></p>

altitude, axis and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple">temperature</a> tracker that
had recently been tested in the field, although the hardware and
software worked well the low temperatures were a challenge, the group
discussed a range of options from

<p>David showed us his progress on an in-system programmer for AVR
micro-controllers and did a great job of explaining
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3808">what they are</a>, and
why you might want one,

<p> The group decided to try out building some
<a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/197">drawduino</a> to see if they would
be a suitable item for us to help newcomers to build and take home and a
date is being set for that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had about 15 people show up at the Arthouse, with talk of Arduinos,
3D printers, teardowns and mobiles. Tea was drunk, cakes were eaten and
a good time was apparently had by all.</p>

<p>Teardowns:</p>

<p>Given a relative success of the first proper meeting of recent years I
believe we&#8217;ll be pushing for another one next month, keep an eye on this
blog for more info as we decide it, or join the

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the powerful organisational skills of Phased / Ben we&#8217;ll be
taming up with the local Dorkbot group to have a big meetup at the
Arthouse Cafe in Southampton.</p>

<blockquote><p>Makers, hackers, tinkerers. Lend me your microphones :O) &#8230;</p>

<p>Following
much consultation, the next Southackton meeting shall be 9th March at
Art House Southampton. Aim is to start at 7.30pm.</p>

<p>We will unite with
the Dorkbots, sharing their March meeting, to create a union of Dorks
and Hackers, possibly for one night only but hopefully a continuing
unity will emerge in the form of Harks or Dockers :O)</p>

<p>Please try to
get there a little early, to have time to grab coffees and cakes, as
that will be the primary method of funding the &#8220;hire&#8221; of the venue /
it&#8217;s continued existence.</p>

<p>As suggested, it will be a combined Duino
and Teardown
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3">http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3</a>
event.</p>

<p>Please bring along anything you have created using the Duino
platforms and anything you fancy Tearing Down.</p>

<p>Please feel free to
share designs / code / links for your Duino creations on our Google
group beforehand, so those attending have an opportunity to discuss
more deeply during the event.</p>

<p>We will aim to leave a 15-20 minute
period near the end for sharing of your unwanted bits from the
Teardowns and discussion on future plans for Southackton.</p>

<p>Look forward
to seeing you all there.</p>

<p>Phased / Ben</p>
