<p>We are a community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to share
skills and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing, regardless
of experience. We want to start a Hackerspace in Southampton, where
people can come to work on their various projects and can get the
resources they need and can share knowledge and ideas. If you always
wanted to make something but don’t know how then our members will be
more than happy to help you.</p>

altitude, axis and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple">temperature</a> tracker that
had recently been tested in the field, although the hardware and
software worked well the low temperatures were a challenge, the group
discussed a range of options from

<p>David showed us his progress on an in-system programmer for AVR
micro-controllers and did a great job of explaining
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3808">what they are</a>, and
why you might want one,

<p> The group decided to try out building some
<a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/197">drawduino</a> to see if they would
be a suitable item for us to help newcomers to build and take home and a
date is being set for that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the powerful organisational skills of Phased / Ben we'll be
taming up with the local Dorkbot group to have a big meetup at the
Arthouse Cafe in Southampton.</p>

<blockquote><p>Makers, hackers, tinkerers. Lend me your microphones :O) ...</p>

<p>Following
much consultation, the next Southackton meeting shall be 9th March at
Art House Southampton. Aim is to start at 7.30pm.</p>

<p>We will unite with
the Dorkbots, sharing their March meeting, to create a union of Dorks
and Hackers, possibly for one night only but hopefully a continuing
unity will emerge in the form of Harks or Dockers :O)</p>

<p>Please try to
get there a little early, to have time to grab coffees and cakes, as
that will be the primary method of funding the "hire" of the venue /
it's continued existence.</p>

<p>As suggested, it will be a combined Duino
and Teardown
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3">http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3</a>
event.</p>

<p>Please bring along anything you have created using the Duino
platforms and anything you fancy Tearing Down.</p>

<p>Please feel free to
share designs / code / links for your Duino creations on our Google
group beforehand, so those attending have an opportunity to discuss
more deeply during the event.</p>

<p>We will aim to leave a 15-20 minute
period near the end for sharing of your unwanted bits from the
Teardowns and discussion on future plans for Southackton.</p>

<p>Look forward
to seeing you all there.</p>

<p>Phased / Ben</p>

<p>We're trying to start a regular meeting of people who enjoy creating or
modifying software and/or hardware and want to meet other like-minded
people. Experience is unnecessary - interest is all we require! Topics
that we're already interested in include: home automation/augmentation,
robotics, circuit bends, programming, computer interfaces, wiimote
hacking, Arduino, gadgets, mobile computing, PVR creation/improvement,
programming, augmented reality, ... so if you're interested in any of
these topics, or have another interest you want to share, why not join
us?</p>
