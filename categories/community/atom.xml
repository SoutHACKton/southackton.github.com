    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to Paul Stimpson on the Surrey LUG mailing list for pointing the
course out:</p>

<blockquote><p>MIT are launching the first course in their new e-learning programme
designed to bring education free to the masses. It's a course in
electronic circuits and design and begins on March 5th. This is a
trial and at this stage does not require any attendance or for proof
of identity to be shown. It is examined online and results in an
MIT-branded certificate for successful students. The only obligations
are to complete the course and exams in the time frame specified and
to agree to the University honour code (not to cheat).</p>

<p>The course runs
for 13 weeks (March 5th until June 8th) and requires a time investment
of approximately 10 hours per week.</p>

<p>You can register at

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We currently have a project going to set up a hackspace in Southampton
early next year. We're talking with the council and various other
helpful people, including the London Hackspace) to try and make it as
awesome as we can. Watch this space for new updates.</p>

<p>If you're interested in joining in then please jump over to our
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton">Google Group</a> and join in the
conversation. The more people who get involved, the better it will be
for everyone.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Southampton<em>-</em>Bargate.JPG/300px-Southampton<em>-</em>Bargate.JPG" title="City of Southampton (via Wikipedia)" >
Wouldn't it be great to have a
"<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" title="Hackerspace Wikipedia Article">Hackerspace</a>"
in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>? A
space hobbyists can go to do software programming and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_(hobbyist)" title="Hacker (hobbyist)">hardware hacking</a>.
The attendees could all share knowledge and help each other out in a fun
and innovative environment.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal would be having an
"office" somewhere in Southampton where members can drop in any time
(within reason) and get to work on their project/just hang out with
fellow hackers. (If you work from home you could potentially even work
form the Hackerspace directly - it wouldn't be so lonely!) This,
however, is likely to take a while to set up as we need to get a number
of interested people, not to mention the office space!</p>

<p>In the mean time,
we're looking at setting up a regular meeting of like minded people. If
you're interested in attending or helping us (sponsorship, coverage,
office space, ...), please get in contact.  <strong>UPDATE</strong>: You can now do
so via <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton" title="SoutHACKton Google Group">our google group</a>.</p>

<p>There is no required skill level - whether you are a beginner, an expert
or anywhere in between you are welcome to attend!</p>

<p>If you're interested -
get in contact!</p>
