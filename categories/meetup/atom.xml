    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are a community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to share
skills and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing, regardless
of experience. We want to start a Hackerspace in Southampton, where
people can come to work on their various projects and can get the
resources they need and can share knowledge and ideas. If you always
wanted to make something but don’t know how then our members will be
more than happy to help you.</p>

<p>This event is a general meetup for existing
members or anyone else who wants to get involved, along with general
discussion about hacking, making and coding… and coffee. It’s free, but
donations to the Arthouse are always appreciated.</p>

<p>The facebook event
page is public so feel free to invite anyone else along.
