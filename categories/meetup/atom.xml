<strong>Location</strong>: <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=50.931982,-1.386822&amp;ll=50.932983,-1.390822&amp;spn=0.015349,0.019248&amp;num=1&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">29th Southampton Scout Hut, Brickfield Road, Southampton</a><br/>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/800px-RaspberryPi.jpeg" title="Raspberry Pi (via Wikipedia)" ></p>

<!-- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RaspberryPi.jpg -->


<p>This event is hosted by <a href="http://29thsouthamptonscouts.org/">29th Southampton Scout Group</a>, all
donations will be passed on to the Scout Group to cover hall hire fees.</p>

<h3>Facilities</h3>

<p>There is no <strong>internet</strong> connection at the Scout Hut, but 3G internet is
available.
<strong>Soldering</strong> is allowed, but will be restricted to a couple of tables to
prevent the spread of damage. Tables, chairs and <strong>electricity</strong> will be
available, but you should bring anything else you'll need (laptops,
components, soldering irons). We encourage our members to <strong>share
resources</strong> with other members, so if you don't have something (e.g. a
soldering iron) then don't worry - I'm sure someone will let you use
theirs.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and biscuits will be available, but you'll need to sort out
your own lunch.</p>

<h3>What is a Hack Day?</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>It's a day where people can bring along their current projects (if any)
and can work on them in the presence of other like-minded individuals.
Others can have a look around, gain inspiration or offer a helping hand,
or just have fun!</p>

<p>Are you just starting out with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="Arduino">Arduino</a>/<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Raspberry Pi mini computer">Raspberry Pi</a>?
Putting the finishing touches on your latest life-size robot? Planning
to build a water jet-pack? Hacking electronics into clothing? Hacking
together the components necessary to make a new GNU/Linux distro or
media centre software? Join us!</p>

<h3>What if I don't have a current project?</h3>

<p>Come along anyway - help with someone else's, or get ideas for what you
could do! Skilled or unskilled, knowledgeable or not-so-knowledgeable,
all are welcome!</p>

<h3>Where do I sign up? What projects are going on there?</h3>

<p>All you need to do is turn up, but the more people that come the merrier
- so let people know you are coming on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton" title="SoutHACKton Google Group">mailing list</a>,
and if you're planning on bringing a project with you then let us know
what it is!</p>
