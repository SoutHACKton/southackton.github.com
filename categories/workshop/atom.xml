<p><img class="left" src="/images/800px-RaspberryPi.jpeg" title="Raspberry Pi (via Wikipedia)" ></p>

<!-- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RaspberryPi.jpg -->


<p>This event is hosted by <a href="http://29thsouthamptonscouts.org/">29th Southampton Scout Group</a>, all
donations will be passed on to the Scout Group to cover hall hire fees.</p>

<h3>Facilities</h3>

<p>There is no <strong>internet</strong> connection at the Scout Hut, but 3G internet is
available.
<strong>Soldering</strong> is allowed, but will be restricted to a couple of tables to
prevent the spread of damage. Tables, chairs and <strong>electricity</strong> will be
available, but you should bring anything else you'll need (laptops,
components, soldering irons). We encourage our members to <strong>share
resources</strong> with other members, so if you don't have something (e.g. a
soldering iron) then don't worry - I'm sure someone will let you use
theirs.</p>

<p>Tea, coffee and biscuits will be available, but you'll need to sort out
your own lunch.</p>

<h3>What is a Hack Day?</h3>

<!-- more -->


<p>It's a day where people can bring along their current projects (if any)
and can work on them in the presence of other like-minded individuals.
Others can have a look around, gain inspiration or offer a helping hand,
or just have fun!</p>

<p>Are you just starting out with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="Arduino">Arduino</a>/<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" title="Raspberry Pi mini computer">Raspberry Pi</a>?
Putting the finishing touches on your latest life-size robot? Planning
to build a water jet-pack? Hacking electronics into clothing? Hacking
together the components necessary to make a new GNU/Linux distro or
media centre software? Join us!</p>

<h3>What if I don't have a current project?</h3>

<p>Come along anyway - help with someone else's, or get ideas for what you
could do! Skilled or unskilled, knowledgeable or not-so-knowledgeable,
all are welcome!</p>

<h3>Where do I sign up? What projects are going on there?</h3>

<p>All you need to do is turn up, but the more people that come the merrier
- so let people know you are coming on our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton" title="SoutHACKton Google Group">mailing list</a>,
and if you're planning on bringing a project with you then let us know
what it is!</p>

had recently been tested in the field, although the hardware and
software worked well the low temperatures were a challenge, the group

<p>David showed us his progress on an in-system programmer for AVR
micro-controllers and did a great job of explaining
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3808">what they are</a>, and
why you might want one,

<p> The group decided to try out building some
<a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/197">drawduino</a> to see if they would
be a suitable item for us to help newcomers to build and take home and a
date is being set for that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the powerful organisational skills of Phased / Ben we'll be
taming up with the local Dorkbot group to have a big meetup at the
Arthouse Cafe in Southampton.</p>

<blockquote><p>Makers, hackers, tinkerers. Lend me your microphones :O) ...</p>

<p>Following
much consultation, the next Southackton meeting shall be 9th March at
Art House Southampton. Aim is to start at 7.30pm.</p>

<p>We will unite with
the Dorkbots, sharing their March meeting, to create a union of Dorks
and Hackers, possibly for one night only but hopefully a continuing
unity will emerge in the form of Harks or Dockers :O)</p>

<p>Please try to
get there a little early, to have time to grab coffees and cakes, as
that will be the primary method of funding the "hire" of the venue /
it's continued existence.</p>

<p>As suggested, it will be a combined Duino
and Teardown
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3">http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3</a>
event.</p>

<p>Please bring along anything you have created using the Duino
platforms and anything you fancy Tearing Down.</p>

<p>Please feel free to
share designs / code / links for your Duino creations on our Google
group beforehand, so those attending have an opportunity to discuss
more deeply during the event.</p>

<p>We will aim to leave a 15-20 minute
period near the end for sharing of your unwanted bits from the
Teardowns and discussion on future plans for Southackton.</p>

<p>Look forward
to seeing you all there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Saturday 20th March 13:00 to 17:00 at SteamShift HQ, 1 Derby Road, Eastleigh, SO50 5QD.</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman" title="Mitch Altman on Wikipedia">Mitch Altman</a>,
well known for making TV-B-Gone (a keychain that turns off TVs in public
places), and also the co-founder of
<a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge" title="Noisebridge hackerspace">Noisebridge</a>,
a really cool San Francisco hackerspace, is coming to Southampton to
teach you How To Make Cool Things with Microcontrollers! In Mitch's
words:</p>

<blockquote><p>You do not need any tools, or any experience to come to the workshop.</p>

<p>The workshop is free (including our time) -- we do this because we
love teaching people to make things. We ask to be reimbursed for any
parts you use from us. Cost of the parts is between £5 and £20,
depending on the project. It is totally fine to bring your own parts
and projects for the workshop.</p>

<p>Here is a list of projects that I'll be
bringing; I've included the prices for the parts:</p>

<p>Mignonette Game kit
@ £20 each
-- a way fun, way low-resolution hand-held computer console
that you can use to create your own games</p>

<p>Trippy RGB Waves kit @ £5
each
-- waves of colors follow your hand as you wave it over these</p>

<p>TV-B-Gone kit @ £15 each -- turn off TVs in public places from up to
50 meter away!</p>

<p>USBtinyISP kit @ £15 each -- a programmer for AVR
microcontrollers</p>

<p>MiniPOV3 kit @ £15 each -- display messages of your
choice through the air you wave this through Brain Machine @ £15 each
-- hallucinate beautiful colors and patterns while you drift off into
fabulous meditation</p>

<p>MintyBoost kit @ £15 each -- with 2 AA batteries
you can charge anything with a USB charging input (such as an iPhone)</p>

<p>Drawdio @£15 each -- fun and annoying noiseamaker that changes noise
as you draw on paper</p>

<p>LEDcube @ £15 each -- 3x3x3 cube of LEDs with
animated sequence</p>

<p>DC BoArduino kit @ £15 each -- Arduino clone kit</p>

<p>FTDI cable @ £15 each -- this is not a kit -- it is required to
communicate with the BoArduino (and many other open-source projects)</p>

<p>TripGlasses @ £25 each -- this is not a kit -- it is a ready-made
version of the Brain Machine (hallucinate beautiful colors and
patterns while meditating!)</p>

<p>EU TV-B-Gone @ £15 each -- this is not a
kit -- it is the ready-made keychain to turn off TVs in public places
(with a stealthy batman-like look)</p>

<p>NA TV-B-Gone Pro SHP @ £30 each --
this is not a kit -- it is a ready-made version, the size of an mp3
player, that turns off TVs in public from up to 150 meter away! One
model for the entire world! Comes with built-in rechargeable batteries
and a charger</p>

<p>Info on most of the above is available on my website:

<p>Jimmie will be bringing Open Heart kits, LOL Shield
kits, Atari Punk Console kits, and some cool circuit bending stuff.

<h2>Sunday 4th October 2009, 10:30am-6:30pm,</h2>

<p><a href="http://steamshift.net/" title="Steamshift">Steamshift</a> HQ</p>

<p>As
<a href="http://www.southackton.org.uk/2009/09/review-of-the-arduino-meet/" title="Review of the Arduino Meet">the Arduino meeting</a>
was such a success, we've already booked our next meetup - a Hack Day -
again kindly hosted by Steamshift at
<a href="http://steamshift.net/page/contact" title="Steamshift HQ">their HQ in Eastleigh</a>.</p>

<h3>What is a Hack Day?</h3>

<p>It's a day where everyone brings along their current projects (if any)
and can work on them in the presence of other like-minded individuals.
Just starting out with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="Arduino">Arduino</a>?
Putting the finishing touches on your latest life-size robot? Planning
to build a water jet-pack? Hacking electronics into clothing? Hacking
together the components necessary to make a new GNU/Linux distro or
media centre software? Join us!</p>

<h3>What if I don't have a current project?</h3>

<p>Come along anyway - help with someone else's! Skilled or unskilled,
knowledgeable or not-so-knowledgeable, all are welcome!</p>

<h3>Why is it so long?</h3>

<p>The idea is that people can turn up when they want for however long they
want - pop in for just a couple of hours or come for the whole day -
it's completely up to you! We anticipate that the busiest time will be
12:30 until 4:30.</p>

<h3>Why so early? (Also: what about lunch?)</h3>

<p>We thought it would be nice to have lunch together (at around 1pm,
though the timing is up to the individual) - some of us will probably
order pizza, others may bring lunch with them. However, we didn't want
to cut into two meal times so we've aimed for "after breakfast and
before dinner." :) Everyone is responsible for bringing/ordering their
own food and drink.</p>

<h3>Where do I sign up?</h3>

<p>This will be another free (no cost) day, all you need to do is turn up.
We like to know how many people are coming though, so please join the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton" title="SoutHACKton Google Group">Google Group</a>
and drop a short message in
t<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/8cacb10d7087a8ac">this hread</a>.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p>This event is kindly hosted by Steamshift.</p>
