altitude, axis and

had recently been tested in the field, although the hardware and
software worked well the low temperatures were a challenge, the group
discussed a range of options from

<p>David showed us his progress on an in-system programmer for AVR
micro-controllers and did a great job of explaining
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3808">what they are</a>, and
why you might want one,

<p> The group decided to try out building some
<a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/197">drawduino</a> to see if they would
be a suitable item for us to help newcomers to build and take home and a
date is being set for that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to the powerful organisational skills of Phased / Ben we'll be
taming up with the local Dorkbot group to have a big meetup at the
Arthouse Cafe in Southampton.</p>

<blockquote><p>Makers, hackers, tinkerers. Lend me your microphones :O) ...</p>

<p>Following
much consultation, the next Southackton meeting shall be 9th March at
Art House Southampton. Aim is to start at 7.30pm.</p>

<p>We will unite with
the Dorkbots, sharing their March meeting, to create a union of Dorks
and Hackers, possibly for one night only but hopefully a continuing
unity will emerge in the form of Harks or Dockers :O)</p>

<p>Please try to
get there a little early, to have time to grab coffees and cakes, as
that will be the primary method of funding the "hire" of the venue /
it's continued existence.</p>

<p>As suggested, it will be a combined Duino
and Teardown
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3">http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3</a>
event.</p>

<p>Please bring along anything you have created using the Duino
platforms and anything you fancy Tearing Down.</p>

<p>Please feel free to
share designs / code / links for your Duino creations on our Google
group beforehand, so those attending have an opportunity to discuss
more deeply during the event.</p>

<p>We will aim to leave a 15-20 minute
period near the end for sharing of your unwanted bits from the
Teardowns and discussion on future plans for Southackton.</p>

<p>Look forward
to seeing you all there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Saturday 20th March 13:00 to 17:00 at SteamShift HQ, 1 Derby Road, Eastleigh, SO50 5QD.</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman" title="Mitch Altman on Wikipedia">Mitch Altman</a>,
well known for making TV-B-Gone (a keychain that turns off TVs in public
places), and also the co-founder of
<a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge" title="Noisebridge hackerspace">Noisebridge</a>,
a really cool San Francisco hackerspace, is coming to Southampton to
teach you How To Make Cool Things with Microcontrollers! In Mitch's
words:</p>

<blockquote><p>You do not need any tools, or any experience to come to the workshop.</p>

<p>The workshop is free (including our time) -- we do this because we
love teaching people to make things. We ask to be reimbursed for any
parts you use from us. Cost of the parts is between £5 and £20,
depending on the project. It is totally fine to bring your own parts
and projects for the workshop.</p>

<p>Here is a list of projects that I'll be
bringing; I've included the prices for the parts:</p>

<p>Mignonette Game kit
@ £20 each
-- a way fun, way low-resolution hand-held computer console
that you can use to create your own games</p>

<p>Trippy RGB Waves kit @ £5
each
-- waves of colors follow your hand as you wave it over these</p>

<p>TV-B-Gone kit @ £15 each -- turn off TVs in public places from up to
50 meter away!</p>

<p>USBtinyISP kit @ £15 each -- a programmer for AVR
microcontrollers</p>

<p>MiniPOV3 kit @ £15 each -- display messages of your
choice through the air you wave this through Brain Machine @ £15 each
-- hallucinate beautiful colors and patterns while you drift off into
fabulous meditation</p>

<p>MintyBoost kit @ £15 each -- with 2 AA batteries
you can charge anything with a USB charging input (such as an iPhone)</p>

<p>Drawdio @£15 each -- fun and annoying noiseamaker that changes noise
as you draw on paper</p>

<p>LEDcube @ £15 each -- 3x3x3 cube of LEDs with
animated sequence</p>

<p>DC BoArduino kit @ £15 each -- Arduino clone kit</p>

<p>FTDI cable @ £15 each -- this is not a kit -- it is required to
communicate with the BoArduino (and many other open-source projects)</p>

<p>TripGlasses @ £25 each -- this is not a kit -- it is a ready-made
version of the Brain Machine (hallucinate beautiful colors and
patterns while meditating!)</p>

<p>EU TV-B-Gone @ £15 each -- this is not a
kit -- it is the ready-made keychain to turn off TVs in public places
(with a stealthy batman-like look)</p>

<p>NA TV-B-Gone Pro SHP @ £30 each --
this is not a kit -- it is a ready-made version, the size of an mp3
player, that turns off TVs in public from up to 150 meter away! One
model for the entire world! Comes with built-in rechargeable batteries
and a charger</p>

<p>Info on most of the above is available on my website:
<a href="http://www.CornfieldElectronics.com">http://www.CornfieldElectronics.com</a>

<h2>Sunday 4th October 2009, 10:30am-6:30pm,</h2>

<p><a href="http://steamshift.net/" title="Steamshift">Steamshift</a> HQ</p>

<p>As
<a href="http://www.southackton.org.uk/2009/09/review-of-the-arduino-meet/" title="Review of the Arduino Meet">the Arduino meeting</a>
was such a success, we've already booked our next meetup - a Hack Day -
again kindly hosted by Steamshift at
<a href="http://steamshift.net/page/contact" title="Steamshift HQ">their HQ in Eastleigh</a>.</p>

<h3>What is a Hack Day?</h3>

<p>It's a day where everyone brings along their current projects (if any)
and can work on them in the presence of other like-minded individuals.
Just starting out with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="Arduino">Arduino</a>?
Putting the finishing touches on your latest life-size robot? Planning
to build a water jet-pack? Hacking electronics into clothing? Hacking
together the components necessary to make a new GNU/Linux distro or
media centre software? Join us!</p>

<h3>What if I don't have a current project?</h3>

<p>Come along anyway - help with someone else's! Skilled or unskilled,
knowledgeable or not-so-knowledgeable, all are welcome!</p>

<h3>Why is it so long?</h3>

<p>The idea is that people can turn up when they want for however long they
want - pop in for just a couple of hours or come for the whole day -
it's completely up to you! We anticipate that the busiest time will be
12:30 until 4:30.</p>

<h3>Why so early? (Also: what about lunch?)</h3>

<p>We thought it would be nice to have lunch together (at around 1pm,
though the timing is up to the individual) - some of us will probably
order pizza, others may bring lunch with them. However, we didn't want
to cut into two meal times so we've aimed for "after breakfast and
before dinner." :) Everyone is responsible for bringing/ordering their
own food and drink.</p>

<h3>Where do I sign up?</h3>

<p>This will be another free (no cost) day, all you need to do is turn up.
We like to know how many people are coming though, so please join the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton" title="SoutHACKton Google Group">Google Group</a>
and drop a short message in
t<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/8cacb10d7087a8ac">this hread</a>.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p>This event is kindly hosted by Steamshift.</p>

<h2>Saturday 29th August 2009, 2pm, <a href="http://steamshift.net/" title="Steamshift">Steamshift</a> HQ</h2>

<p>Steamshift have kindly offered to host our next meeting which is
targetted at introducing us to the Arduino and similar development
boards.</p>

<p><strong>No prior knowledge is necessary</strong>, but if you already have an
Arduino/Freeduino/PICAXE/etc board, please feel free to bring it along,
and if you like you can even teach the rest of us about it. Andy from
Steamshift will be bringing a number with him, and there are a number of
people on the groups who will be bringing theirs too.</p>

<p>I don't feel
knowledgeable enough to tell you much about Arduino, so instead, I
suggest you go to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino" title="Wikipedia Arduino article">Wikipedia</a>,
or <a href="http://arduino.cc/">the Arduino website</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for
artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating
interactive objects or environments.</p>

<p>Arduino can sense the
environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can
affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other
actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the</p>

<p><a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage">Arduino programming language</a> (based on
<a href="http://wiring.org.co/">Wiring</a>) and the Arduino development
environment (based on <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a>).
Arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with
software on running on a computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).</p>

<p>The boards can be
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardSerialSingleSided3">built by hand</a> or
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy">purchased</a> preassembled; the software
can be <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">downloaded</a> for free. The
hardware reference designs (CAD files) are
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Hardware">available</a> under an open-source
license, you are free to
<a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Policy">adapt them to your needs</a>.</p>

<p>Arduino received an Honory
Mention in the Digital Communities section of the 2006 Ars Electronica
Prix.</p></blockquote>

<p>Please, if you have any friends who you think might be interested,
spread the word! Arduino is a very flexible platform and can be used for
hardware hacking, home automation, robotics, and millions of other
things.</p>

<p>Bring as much of the following as you can (all are totally
OPTIONAL):</p>

<ul>
<li>Laptop with a free USB port</li>
<li>Arduino/Freeduino/PICAXE/etc boards (I suggest marking them in some
way so they don't get mixed up!)</li>
<li>Components: breadboards, LEDs, resistors, capacitors, Arduino
shields, light dependant resistors, proximity sensors, speakers,
buzzers, switches, ...</li>
<li>Cash (in case a quick trip to Maplin might be required, or in case
you want to buy an Arduino board/some components off of someone
else)</li>
<li>Camera/camcorder to document the day!</li>
</ul>


<p>If you can make it, please let us know
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/f1c7dbed898e7a15">in the group</a>
or by commenting on this post so we know how many people to expect.</p>

<p>My
thanks go out again to the guys at Steamshift, especially Andy, for
making this next meetup possible:</p>
