    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to Paul Stimpson on the Surrey LUG mailing list for pointing the
course out:</p>

<blockquote><p>MIT are launching the first course in their new e-learning programme
designed to bring education free to the masses. It's a course in
electronic circuits and design and begins on March 5th. This is a
trial and at this stage does not require any attendance or for proof
of identity to be shown. It is examined online and results in an
MIT-branded certificate for successful students. The only obligations
are to complete the course and exams in the time frame specified and
to agree to the University honour code (not to cheat).</p>

<p>The course runs
for 13 weeks (March 5th until June 8th) and requires a time investment
of approximately 10 hours per week.</p>

<p>You can register at

<p>I’m working on a new project, I’ve got a
<a href="http://www.earthshinedesign.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=38_43&amp;product_id=82" title="8x8 dual colour dot matrix display">8×8 dual colour dot matrix display</a>
(£2.50 delivered from Earthshine Design) and I want to power it from the
<a href="http://www.arduino.cc" title="Arduino">Arduino</a>. One way of making a chip
like that (which has 2×8x8 = 128
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode" title="Light-emitting diode">LEDs</a>)
would be to have a common ground and an additional 128 pins – one for
each LED. This, I think you’d agree, would be a nightmare, so instead
they’ve basically gone for an 8×16 grid for a total of 24 pins. This
raises two main problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can’t turn 2 arbitrary LEDs on at the same time unless they are
on the same row/column. (Doing so would actually draw a square of
LEDs.)</li>
<li>My Arduino doesn’t have enough digital input/output pins</li>
</ol>


<p>Point 1 is easily solved – we simply update just one row at a time,
letting
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision">Persistance Of Vision</a> (POV) do the
hard work for us. Point 2 is the subject of this post –
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing" title="Multiplexing">multiplexing</a>,
combining multiple individual signals into just one signal. I will not
be using this dot matrix display in this post, instead I will simply be
powering normal LEDs. I wanted to find out if the Arduino is fast enough
to multiplex the data through just a few pins in order to power this
display. The answer (one of my favourite answers!) is: “Yes, but not
without some hacking.” Read on…</p>
