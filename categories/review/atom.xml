    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had about 15 people show up at the Arthouse, with talk of Arduinos,
3D printers, teardowns and mobiles. Tea was drunk, cakes were eaten and
a good time was apparently had by all.</p>

<p>Teardowns:</p>

<p>Given a relative success of the first proper meeting of recent years I
believe we'll be pushing for another one next month, keep an eye on this
blog for more info as we decide it, or join the

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman" title="Mitch Altman on Wikipedia">Mitch Altman</a>,
(inventor of TV-B-Gone, and co-founder of

and <a href="http://jimmieprodgers.com/">Jimmie P Rodgers</a> (circuit bender and

<a href="http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/openheart/">LED hearts</a> and
<a href="http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/lolshield/">LoL shields</a>) joined us at
SteamShift HQ in Eastleigh to put on a workshop excitingly titled "How
To Make Cool Things with Microcontrollers!"</p>

<p><img src="http://theuncommon.co.uk/hackspace/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/photo-300x225.jpg" width="300" title="Mitch Altman teaching soldering" ></p>

<p>Mitch gave a great introduction to microcontrollers, and entertained
everyone with, among other tales, his experiences in the US, recounting
how he left his job in Silicone Valley and got into hardware hacking,
and amusingly how the Noisebridge hackerspace is insured somewhere under
the category of "Artistic Robotics".</p>

<p>He and Jimmy had a great selection
of projects on show and available as kits for hacking; the LoL Shields
went down well, around 6 of us opted to build them for our arduinos.</p>

<p>Another attendee constructed an

else constructed their first arduino clone from a
<a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/boarduino/">Boarduino kit</a>.</p>

<p>Our guests continued their
tour of the UK the following day, going on to their
<a href="http://buildbrighton.eventwax.com/elecrtonics-workshop-with-mitch-altman">next event</a>
at the
<a href="http://www.buildbrighton.com/">Brighton hackerspace BuildBrighton</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Our next meeting, Hack Day 1, is on 4th October.
<a href="http://www.southackton.org.uk/2009/09/hack-day-1-meetup/" title="Hack Day 1">Click here</a>
for details.</em></p>

<p>At 2pm Saturday 29th of August, on an otherwise uneventful
bank holiday weekend, a varied group of men and women met at
<a href="http://steamshift.net/">Steamshift</a> HQ. Their purpose - to get down to
business and HACK! Some arrived with projects in mind - disco lights,
energy usage monitoring, laser mazes - while others turned up with
little equipment but an eagerness to get their hands dirty. At the full
height of the meet, there were around twenty people there, playing
around with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> and
<a href="http://www.rev-ed.co.uk/picaxe/">PIXACE</a> boards.</p>

<p><img src="http://theuncommon.co.uk/hackspace/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sothackton2.jpg" alt="Southackton Meet" /></p>

<p>The meet was organised and hosted by
<a href="http://twitter.com/steamshift" title="@steamshift">Andy Bennett</a> and Steamshift as
part of SoutHACKton - a group of like-minded Solent residents who all
want to kick back, take stuff apart and build new things out of the
resulting mess.</p>

<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3660/3874748845_6c40e25cef_m.jpg"><img src="http://theuncommon.co.uk/hackspace/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sothackton3.jpg" alt="Southackton Meet" /></a></p>

<p>And that they did - sometimes clusterd in small groups, working away on
personal projects, sometimes coming together in larger groups to admire
a piece of someone else's handy work. Projects that drew particular
attention were Ruzz's walking robots (a hit at our last meet too),
<a href="http://twitter.com/fraz3alpha" title="@fraz3alpha">Andy T</a>'s LEDs (Did I mention he
has 4,000 LEDs?) and my own project: Lou Lou the Furby. I hope to hook
Lou Lou up to the PC and tell me when I get new email. Maybe she'll get
her <a href="http://twitter.com/Bubblino" title="Bubblino">own twitter account</a> one
day. For now, she'll just have to be happy playing sounds from my eeePC
through an Arduino.</p>
