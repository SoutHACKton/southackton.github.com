## Saturday 29th August 2009, 2pm, [Steamshift](http://steamshift.net/ "Steamshift") HQ

Steamshift have kindly offered to host our next meeting which is
targetted at introducing us to the Arduino and similar development
boards. 

**No prior knowledge is necessary**, but if you already have an
Arduino/Freeduino/PICAXE/etc board, please feel free to bring it along,
and if you like you can even teach the rest of us about it. Andy from
Steamshift will be bringing a number with him, and there are a number of
people on the groups who will be bringing theirs too. 

I don't feel
knowledgeable enough to tell you much about Arduino, so instead, I
suggest you go to
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino "Wikipedia Arduino article"),
or [the Arduino website](http://arduino.cc/):

> Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
> flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for
> artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating
> interactive objects or environments. 
> 
> Arduino can sense the
> environment by receiving input from a variety of sensors and can
> affect its surroundings by controlling lights, motors, and other
> actuators. The microcontroller on the board is programmed using the
> 
[Arduino programming language](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage) (based on
> [Wiring](http://wiring.org.co/)) and the Arduino development
> environment (based on [Processing](http://www.processing.org/)).
> Arduino projects can be stand-alone or they can communicate with
> software on running on a computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP).
> 
> The boards can be 
[built by hand](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardSerialSingleSided3) or
> [purchased](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Buy) preassembled; the software
> can be [downloaded](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for free. The
> hardware reference designs (CAD files) are
> [available](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Hardware) under an open-source
> license, you are free to 
[adapt them to your needs](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Policy). 
> 
> Arduino received an Honory
> Mention in the Digital Communities section of the 2006 Ars Electronica
> Prix.

Please, if you have any friends who you think might be interested,
spread the word! Arduino is a very flexible platform and can be used for
hardware hacking, home automation, robotics, and millions of other
things. 

Bring as much of the following as you can (all are totally
OPTIONAL):

-   Laptop with a free USB port
-   Arduino/Freeduino/PICAXE/etc boards (I suggest marking them in some
    way so they don't get mixed up!)
-   Components: breadboards, LEDs, resistors, capacitors, Arduino
    shields, light dependant resistors, proximity sensors, speakers,
    buzzers, switches, ...
-   Cash (in case a quick trip to Maplin might be required, or in case
    you want to buy an Arduino board/some components off of someone
    else)
-   Camera/camcorder to document the day!

If you can make it, please let us know
[in the group](http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/f1c7dbed898e7a15)
or by commenting on this post so we know how many people to expect. 

My
thanks go out again to the guys at Steamshift, especially Andy, for
making this next meetup possible:
