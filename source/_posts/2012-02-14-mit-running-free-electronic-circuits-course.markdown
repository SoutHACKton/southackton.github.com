Thanks to Paul Stimpson on the Surrey LUG mailing list for pointing the
course out:

> MIT are launching the first course in their new e-learning programme
> designed to bring education free to the masses. It's a course in
> electronic circuits and design and begins on March 5th. This is a
> trial and at this stage does not require any attendance or for proof
> of identity to be shown. It is examined online and results in an
> MIT-branded certificate for successful students. The only obligations
> are to complete the course and exams in the time frame specified and
> to agree to the University honour code (not to cheat). The course runs
> for 13 weeks (March 5th until June 8th) and requires a time investment
> of approximately 10 hours per week. You can register at
> https://6002x.mitx.mit.edu/
