<p>We have the pleasure of having a guest speaker, Andy Stanford-Clark,
coming to talk about &#8220;Innovation for a Smarter Planet&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Andy Stanford-Clark will introduce technology which is helping to
make the planet smarter: instrumenting objects in the real world with
sensors, linking them together over a network, and then applying
intelligent applications to reason about what&#8217;s happening, and how to
react accordingly.  Andy will illustrate this &#8220;smarter planet&#8221; vision
with features of his home automation system, including monitoring
power consumption and water usage, remote control of electrical
appliances from his mobile phone, and his electronic mouse traps! He
will describe other applications of this technology, including vehicle
telematics and the intriguing world of &#8220;tweetjects&#8221; - objects that
Twitter.</p>

<p>Professor Andy Stanford-Clark is the Chief Technologist for IBM&#8217;s
consulting business in Energy and Utilities for the UK and Ireland. He
is an IBM Distinguished Engineer, and &#8220;Master Inventor&#8221; with more than
40 patents. Andy is based at IBM&#8217;s Hursley Park laboratories in the
UK, and specialises in remote telemetry, energy monitoring and
management, Smart Metering and Smart Grid technologies. He has a
particular interest in home energy monitoring, home automation,
demand-side management, and driving consumer behaviour change.  Andy
has a BSc in Computing and Mathematics, and a PhD in Computer Science.
He is a visiting professor at the University of Newcastle and a Fellow
of the British Computer Society. &#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>We are a community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to
share skills and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing,
regardless of experience. We want to start a Hackerspace in
Southampton, where people can come to work on their various projects
and can get the resources they need and can share knowledge and ideas.
If you always wanted to make something but don&#8217;t know how then our
members will be more than happy to help you.</p>

<p>This event is a general meetup for existing members or anyone else who
wants to get involved, along with general discussion about hacking,
making and coding and coffee. It&#8217;s free, but donations to the
Arthouse are always appreciated.</p>

<p>This facebook event page is public so feel free to invite anyone else along.</p>
