We had about 15 people show up at the Arthouse, with talk of Arduinos,
3D printers, teardowns and mobiles. Tea was drunk, cakes were eaten and
a good time was apparently had by all. 

Teardowns:

Given a relative success of the first proper meeting of recent years I
believe we'll be pushing for another one next month, keep an eye on this
blog for more info as we decide it, or join the 
[Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/southackton) to get involved.
