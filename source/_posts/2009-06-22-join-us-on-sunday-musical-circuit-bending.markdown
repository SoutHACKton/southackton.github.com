# Sunday 28th June, 3pm

I'll be hosting the event at my flat, the address is on [this
page](http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/web/contact-benjie "Contact Benjie")
(members only - it only takes a moment to become a member). If you're
coming, please comment on this post/post a message to groups/email me so
I know how many people to expect.

> ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED. Fun for all the family! Come and
> make some noise and eat some pizza with us! Just go down to your local
> charity shop/poundland/etc and buy some very cheap noise producing
> electronics (such as press and talk/ speak and spell/ my first
> electric keyboard/etc) and bring them along. Your task will be to
> expose the electronics and see what noises you can make by shorting
> connectors with your wet finger. “Lick it and see!” The coolest
> noises/tunes from the cheapest electronics win. Strictly battery
> powered devices only. (I'd recommend buying a few devices as some will
> be more hackable than others.)

Looking forward to seeing you!
