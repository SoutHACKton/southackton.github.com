A good time was had by all, we looked at a unique Snowboarding location,
altitude, axis and
[temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple) tracker that
had recently been tested in the field, although the hardware and
software worked well the low temperatures were a challenge, the group
discussed a range of options from [heat
pumps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump), wicks, [peltier
devices](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-the-peltier-effect.htm) to
[phase-change
materials](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_change_material) as used
in the [magic metal coffee
beans](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/705847536/coffee-joulies-your-coffee-just-right)!
\
 David showed us his progress on an in-system programmer for AVR
micro-controllers and did a great job of explaining [what they
are](http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=3808), and
why you might want one, [read more about his
projects](http://www.asguard.org.uk/2010/12/10/thermocouple-conversion/#more-116).
\
 The group decided to try out building some
[drawduino](http://www.adafruit.com/products/197) to see if they would
be a suitable item for us to help newcomers to build and take home and a
date is being set for that. \
