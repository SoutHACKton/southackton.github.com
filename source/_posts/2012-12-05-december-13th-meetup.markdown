The next SoutHACKton meetup is Thursday 13th December, 7.30pm @ DHaus:
Suite R Medina Chambers, Town Quay, Southampton, SO14 2AQ.
Please use the [facebook
event](https://www.facebook.com/events/502258979814792/) to let us know
you are coming!

We are a community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to
share skills and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing,
regardless of experience. We want to start a Hackerspace in
Southampton, where people can come to work on their various projects
and can get the resources they need and can share knowledge and ideas.
If you always wanted to make something but don't know how then our
members will be more than happy to help you.

This event is a general meetup for existing members or anyone else who
wants to get involved. It's a little early this month to fit in before
Christmas. This facebook event page is public so feel free to invite
anyone else along.
