Last week's workshop was great fun despite the dreary weather! [Mitch
Altman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman "Mitch Altman on Wikipedia"),
(inventor of TV-B-Gone, and co-founder of
[Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge "Noisebridge  hackerspace"))
and [Jimmie P Rodgers](http://jimmieprodgers.com/) (circuit bender and
purveyor of [Atari Punk Consoles](http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/apc/),
[LED hearts](http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/openheart/) and [LoL
shields](http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/lolshield/)) joined us at
SteamShift HQ in Eastleigh to put on a workshop excitingly titled "How
To Make Cool Things with Microcontrollers!" [caption id="attachment\_88"

Mitch gave a great introduction to microcontrollers, and entertained
everyone with, among other tales, his experiences in the US, recounting
how he left his job in Silicone Valley and got into hardware hacking,
and amusingly how the Noisebridge hackerspace is insured somewhere under
the category of "Artistic Robotics". He and Jimmy had a great selection
of projects on show and available as kits for hacking; the LoL Shields
went down well, around 6 of us opted to build them for our arduinos.

Another attendee constructed an [Atari Punk
Console](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Punk_Console), while someone
else constructed their first arduino clone from a [Boarduino
kit](http://www.ladyada.net/make/boarduino/). Our guests continued their
tour of the UK the following day, going on to their [next
event](http://buildbrighton.eventwax.com/elecrtonics-workshop-with-mitch-altman)
at the [Brighton hackerspace
BuildBrighton](http://www.buildbrighton.com/). If you're interested in
hardware hacking or learning to solder, why not join the discussions on
our [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/)? If you
