Thanks to the powerful organisational skills of Phased / Ben we'll be
taming up with the local Dorkbot group to have a big meetup at the
Arthouse Cafe in Southampton.

> Makers, hackers, tinkerers. Lend me your microphones :O) ... 
> 
> Following
> much consultation, the next Southackton meeting shall be 9th March at
> Art House Southampton. Aim is to start at 7.30pm. 
> 
> We will unite with
> the Dorkbots, sharing their March meeting, to create a union of Dorks
> and Hackers, possibly for one night only but hopefully a continuing
> unity will emerge in the form of Harks or Dockers :O) 
> 
> Please try to
> get there a little early, to have time to grab coffees and cakes, as
> that will be the primary method of funding the "hire" of the venue /
> it's continued existence. 
> 
> As suggested, it will be a combined Duino
> and Teardown
> <http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse\_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3>
> event. 
> 
> Please bring along anything you have created using the Duino
> platforms and anything you fancy Tearing Down. 
> 
> Please feel free to
> share designs / code / links for your Duino creations on our Google
> group beforehand, so those attending have an opportunity to discuss
> more deeply during the event. 
> 
> We will aim to leave a 15-20 minute
> period near the end for sharing of your unwanted bits from the
> Teardowns and discussion on future plans for Southackton. 
> 
> Look forward
> to seeing you all there.
