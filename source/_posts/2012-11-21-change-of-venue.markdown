Tom Frame of [DHaus][] has kindly offered to host our next meeting at
his offices, which will allow us a bit more space and freedom than
usual. Do please bring along any projects you are working on that you
think may be of interest to other SoHa members and you can even solder
if you need to!

**This meeting will be Thursday 29th November from 7:30pm @ DHaus: Suite R
Medina Chambers, Town Quay, Southampton, SO14 2AQ.**

If you're coming let us know on the (public) [Facebook event][] - and
feel free to invite your friends! BYOB and pizza/etc welcome.

This event is a general meetup for existing members or anyone else who
wants to get involved, along with general discussion about hacking,
making and coding. It's completely free.

We are a community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to share
skills and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing, regardless
of experience. If you always wanted to make something but don't know how
then our members will be more than happy to help you.
