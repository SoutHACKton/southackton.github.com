ABSOLUTELY NO KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED. Fun for all the family! 

Come and make
some noise and eat some pizza with us! Just go down to your local
charity shop/poundland/etc and buy some very cheap noise producing
electronics (such as press and talk/ speak and spell/ my first electric
keyboard/etc) and bring them along. Your task will be to expose the
electronics and see what noises you can make by shorting connectors with
your wet finger. "Lick it and see!" The coolest noises/tunes from the
cheapest electronics win. Strictly battery powered devices only. 

When
are you free during 28th June - 7th July? Please fill out your
[availability on Doodle](http://doodle.com/33wnk67nmzz9x8ds "Circuit Bending Availability Southampton")
