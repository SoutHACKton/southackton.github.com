On Friday (15th) from 7:30pm we shall be moving what equipment we have
from the [donations
list](http://wiki.somakeit.org.uk/wiki/Equipment_Donations) & other
sources into the space. If you are donating a thing and you need help
moving it, you can mail a
[trustee](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/trustees/). Feel free to bring
projects along too, we've seen that we can make lightning progress
(thanks to all who helped on Saturday) and I'm sure there'll be time for
hacking.
