To help us gather data for an upcoming meeting with 
[Southampton University][] to discuss their potential 
support for a Southampton-based [hackerspace][] (a.k.a. makerspace,
creative space - see excerpt below), we've created a brief [survey][].  It's short and to the point - it
{" should only take you three minutes to fill out "} - 
but even if you only answer the first two questions (around 15 seconds)
that will help us tremendously!

The hackerspaces.org [List of Hacker Spaces][hackerspaces/listof]
map shows that Southampton is perfectly positioned to host a location
for makers, hackers and tinkerers from a wide area to meet and collaborate.

{% blockquote Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace Hackerspace %}
A hackerspace or hackspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace or creative space) is a location where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital or electronic art (but also in many other realms) can meet, socialise and/or collaborate. Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops, workshops and/or studios where hackers can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things.

Many hackerspaces participate in the use and development of free software, open hardware, and alternative media. They are often physically located in infoshops, social centers, adult education centers, or on university campuses, but may relocate to industrial or warehouse space when they need more room.

Results of the survey will be aggregated and announced at a later date.
