To help us gather data for an upcoming meeting with 
[Southampton University][] to discuss their potential 
support for a Southampton-based [hackerspace][], 
we've created a short [survey][].  It's short and to the point - it
{" should only take 3 minutes to fill out "} - 
but even if you only answer the first two questions (around 15 seconds)
that will help us tremendously!

Results will be aggregated and announced at a later date.
