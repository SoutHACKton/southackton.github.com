Now that we have our space, we want to open it up for everyone to come and play. Unfortunately we are unable to give everyone a key. We currently have 5 keyholders, our trustees, so we have to fit everyones schedules.

We ran a poll to find out when you wanted to come, and the results are as follows:
<img src="/images/2013-03-access-times-survey-results.png" />

We tried to pick the best times for us to open the space, so we can commit to it every week, and when you said you wanted to come. We have arrived at the following:  

### Opening Hours
Tuesdays: 7.30pm - 10.30pm   
Saturdays: 2pm - 8pm

We will be attempting to always have someone available during these times, every week. (Except on some public holidays, when it is worth checking we won't be closed).

### Ad-Hoc access
Of course we also are available for ad-hoc openings or special access times. To help coordinate this, we'll be building something in the members site (volunteers needed!) but in the mean time you can pop onto [IRC](https://wiki.somakeit.org.uk/wiki/IRC) and ask a trustee (they generally have operator status); or send a message to the mailing list. When we're opening the space we'll try and remember to tweet out (on @MakeSoton - the So Make It twitter account) or post to the mailing list.

We hope to see you all regularly!
