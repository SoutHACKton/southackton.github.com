Now that we have a space, we want to open it up for everyone to come and play. Unfortunately we are unable to give everyone a key, so we have to try and fit the schedules of both our members and the keyholders. We currently have 5 keyholders - [our trustees][trustees].

To help us guage when you wanted to come we ran a poll; the results are as follows:  
![poll results](/images/2013-03-access-times-survey-results.png)

We analysed these results, reconciled them with keyholder availability, and are happy to announce that we can commit to having the space open the following times each week:

### Opening Hours
Tuesdays: 7.30pm - 10.30pm   
Saturdays: 2pm - 8pm

Our aim is to always have someone available during these times, every week. *(We may not be open on some public holidays - it's probably worth checking if you're unsure.)*

### Ad-Hoc access
Of course we will also be opening the space for ad-hoc openings or special access times. We want to build something to help coordinate/organise this (volunteers needed - get in touch!) but in the mean time you can pop onto [IRC](https://wiki.somakeit.org.uk/wiki/IRC) and ask a trustee (they generally have operator status); or send a message to [the mailing list][ggroups]. 

When the space is (going to be) open we'll try and remember to tweet out (on [@MakeSoton][] - the So Make It twitter account) or post to the mailing list. If you notice we haven't done so, please inform someone so that it can be rectified.

We hope to see you all regularly!
