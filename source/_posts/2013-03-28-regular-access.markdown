The results of our access times survey are as follows:
<img src="/images/2013-03-access-times-survey-results.png" />

The trustees tried to find times which suited both you, and them and we came up with the following opening days and hours every week.

Tuesdays: 7.30pm - 10.30pm   
Saturdays: 2pm - 8pm

We are hoping to always have someone on site during these hours so you can just drop in whenever you feel like it.  
If the date falls on something special it might be worth checking this blog and the mailing list, as we certainly won't be opening it on New Years day (unless it is to continue a party!)

We hope to see you all regularly!
