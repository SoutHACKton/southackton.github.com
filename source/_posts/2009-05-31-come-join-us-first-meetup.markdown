Do you enjoy tinkering with software or hardware? Got a cool project you
want help with, or want to help with some cool projects? Live in or
around Southampton?

Join us for our first meetup at **5pm on 13th June** at [The Crown Inn,
Southampton](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=the+crown+inn,+highcrown+street,+southampton&sll=50.931916,-1.400186&sspn=0.001263,0.002867&ie=UTF8&ll=50.932902,-1.399426&spn=0.019555,0.045877&z=15&iwloc=A "The Crown Inno, Southampton on Google Maps")!

We're trying to start a regular meeting of people who enjoy creating or
modifying software and/or hardware and want to meet other like-minded
people. Experience is unnecessary - interest is all we require! Topics
that we're already interested in include: home automation/augmentation,
robotics, circuit bends, programming, computer interfaces, wiimote
hacking, Arduino, gadgets, mobile computing, PVR creation/improvement,
programming, augmented reality, ... so if you're interested in any of
these topics, or have another interest you want to share, why not join
us?
