We currently have a project going to set up a hackspace in Southampton
early next year. We're talking with the council and various other
helpful people, including the London Hackspace) to try and make it as
awesome as we can. Watch this space for new updates.

If you're interested in joining in then please jump over to our 
[Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/southackton) and join in the
conversation. The more people who get involved, the better it will be
for everyone.
