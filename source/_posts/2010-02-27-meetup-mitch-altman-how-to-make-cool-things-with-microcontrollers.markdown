Eastleigh, SO50 5QD.

[Mitch
Altman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman "Mitch Altman on Wikipedia"),
well known for making TV-B-Gone (a keychain that turns off TVs in public
places), and also the co-founder of
[Noisebridge](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge "Noisebridge hackerspace"),
a really cool San Francisco hackerspace, is coming to Southampton to
teach you How To Make Cool Things with Microcontrollers! In Mitch's
words:

> You do not need any tools, or any experience to come to the workshop.
> The workshop is free (including our time) -- we do this because we
> love teaching people to make things. We ask to be reimbursed for any
> parts you use from us. Cost of the parts is between £5 and £20,
> depending on the project. It is totally fine to bring your own parts
> and projects for the workshop. Here is a list of projects that I'll be
> bringing; I've included the prices for the parts: Mignonette Game kit
> @ £20 each -- a way fun, way low-resolution hand-held computer console
> that you can use to create your own games Trippy RGB Waves kit @ £5
> each -- waves of colors follow your hand as you wave it over these
> TV-B-Gone kit @ £15 each -- turn off TVs in public places from up to
> 50 meter away! USBtinyISP kit @ £15 each -- a programmer for AVR
> microcontrollers MiniPOV3 kit @ £15 each -- display messages of your
> choice through the air you wave this through Brain Machine @ £15 each
