<div class="entry-content"><p>The next SoutHACKton meetup is Tues 24th July, 7.30pm at the Art House
Southampton - please use the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/140233812766896/">facebook event</a> to let us know
you are coming!</p>

<p>We are a community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to
share skills and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing,
regardless of experience. We want to start a Hackerspace in
Southampton, where people can come to work on their various projects
and can get the resources they need and can share knowledge and ideas.
If you always wanted to make something but don&#8217;t know how then our
members will be more than happy to help you.</p>

<p>This event is a general meetup for existing members or anyone else who
wants to get involved, along with general discussion about hacking,
making and coding and coffee. It&#8217;s free, but donations to the
Arthouse are always appreciated.</p>

<p>This facebook event page is public so feel free to invite anyone else along.</p>

<p>This event is at <a href="http://www.thearthousesouthampton.co.uk/">the Art House</a></p>
