Our next meetup is 7:30pm until 10:00pm Wednesday, December 7, 2011. 

Let
us know you are coming on facebook:  
[http://www.facebook.com/events/316444395051818/](http://www.facebook.com/events/316444395051818/)

This event is a general meetup for existing members or anyone else who
wants to get involved, along with general discussion about hacking,
making and coding… and coffee. It’s free, but donations to the Arthouse
are always appreciated. 

The facebook event page is public so feel free
to invite anyone else along. 

This event is at the Art House:

We are a community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to share
skills and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing, regardless
of experience. We want to start a Hackerspace in Southampton, where
people can come to work on their various projects and can get the
resources they need and can share knowledge and ideas. If you always
wanted to make something but don’t know how then our members will be
more than happy to help you.
