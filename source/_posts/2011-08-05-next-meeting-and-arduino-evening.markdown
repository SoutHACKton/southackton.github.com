There'll be more discussion on forming a company, setting up our space,
funding options etc. Along with general discussion about hacking, making
and coding... and coffee. It's **free,** but donations to the Arthouse
are always appreciated.

Our members will also be bringing along their various Arduino projects
to show off and explain ( info on Arduinos can be found here:
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino)
) and there'll be opportunities to get your hands dirty actually trying
out the boards. So if you're interested, even if you've never touched
electronics or coding before, then come along. There's a Facebook event
