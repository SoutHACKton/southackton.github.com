The next SoutHACKton meetup will be a Ubuntu workshop at the Art House,
Southampton at 7.30pm

Bring a laptop and a USB stick (2GB is a good size, or if you bring 4GB
or larger then you can save settings and data back to it and use it like
it was installed).

We will get you up and running with the latest version of Ubuntu Linux,
without installing anything on your laptop, so you won't lose any data.

More information about Ubuntu, and linux, is available at:
<http://ubuntu.com/ubuntu>

This facebook event page is public so feel free to invite anyone else
along.

This event is at the Art House: <http://www.thearthousesouthampton.co.uk/>
