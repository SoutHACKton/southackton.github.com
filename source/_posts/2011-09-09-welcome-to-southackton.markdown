Welcome to SoutHACKton, the Southampton Hackerspace project. 

We are a
community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to share skills
and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing, regardless of
experience. We want to start a Hackerspace in Southampton, where people
can come to work on their various projects and can get the resources
they need and can share knowledge and ideas. If you always wanted to
make something but don't know how then our members will be more than
happy to help you. 

We have regular meetings of people who enjoy creating
or modifying software and/or hardware and want to meet other like-minded
people. Experience is unnecessary - interest is all we require! Topics
that we’re already interested in include: home automation/augmentation,
robotics, circuit bends, programming, computer interfaces, wiimote
hacking, Arduino, gadgets, mobile computing, PVR creation/improvement,
programming, augmented reality, … so if you’re interested in any of
these topics, or have another interest you want to share, why not join
us? 

For more details, including a map to our usual meetup place, see
