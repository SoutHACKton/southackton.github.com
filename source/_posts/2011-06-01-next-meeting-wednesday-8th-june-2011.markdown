The ever expanding Southackton group will be meeting once again at the
Art House in Southampton.
 
Bring yourself and any old bit's of hardware or kit that you want to
re-factor into something wonderful, or just reduce to a pile of bits,
it's up to you! 

 Adam Groves was interviewed with *Zoe Kleinman*on BBC Radio Solent,
link removed due to BBC's epic failure to curate our digital heritage...

 From 7.30pm until we get bored... 

 **The Art House Southampton CIC** 

178 Above Bar Street  
Southampton  
SO14 7DW
