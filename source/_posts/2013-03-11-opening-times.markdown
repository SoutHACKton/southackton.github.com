Now that we have a space, we intend to open it up more regularly. As we have 5 keyholders we are limited to the amount of time we can open, so we want to make sure we are open when it suits you the most.

To that end, you can [help by filling out a survey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/XVBLT6S) to show what days and times you would regularly use the space.

Once we have the results of the survey, the [trustees](http://www.somakeit.org.uk/trustees/) will work out when we should be opening the most. We are intending to have the same slot(s) each week, to keep things simple.
