On Thursday (21st March 2013) at 7:30pm a few of us will be at
[the space][rideride] testing Acetone vapour bath smoothing of 3D parts
printed in ABS. We'll also be performing 'safety testing', and
documenting the tests on video for the
[SoMakeIt YouTube channel][youtube].

All are welcome to come along and join in the fun, but if you want to
get involved please bring your own safety goggles and gloves.

We are on Hollybrook Road (SO16 6PB), inside the 
[rideride premises][rideride].

Please see the [facebook event][facebook] for more information and to
let us know you're coming.
