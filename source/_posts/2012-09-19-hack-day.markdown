This event is hosted by [29th Southampton Scout Group][29th], all
donations will be passed on to the Scout Group to cover hall hire fees.

### Facilities

There is no **internet** connection at the Scout Hut, but 3G internet is
available.
**Soldering** is allowed, but will be restricted to a couple of tables to
prevent the spread of damage. Tables, chairs and **electricity** will be
available, but you should bring anything else you'll need (laptops,
components, soldering irons). We encourage our members to **share
resources** with other members, so if you don't have something (e.g. a
soldering iron) then don't worry - I'm sure someone will let you use
theirs.

Tea, coffee and biscuits will be available, but you'll need to sort out
your own lunch.

### What is a Hack Day?

<!-- more -->

It's a day where people can bring along their current projects (if any)
and can work on them in the presence of other like-minded individuals.
Others can have a look around, gain inspiration or offer a helping hand,
or just have fun!

Are you just starting out with [Arduino][]/[Raspberry Pi][RaspPi]?
Putting the finishing touches on your latest life-size robot? Planning
to build a water jet-pack? Hacking electronics into clothing? Hacking
together the components necessary to make a new GNU/Linux distro or
media centre software? Join us!

### What if I don't have a current project?

Come along anyway - help with someone else's, or get ideas for what you
could do! Skilled or unskilled, knowledgeable or not-so-knowledgeable,
all are welcome!

### Where do I sign up? What projects are going on there?

All you need to do is turn up, but the more people that come the merrier
- so let people know you are coming on our [mailing list][mailinglist],
and if you're planning on bringing a project with you then let us know
what it is!
