Welcome to SoutHACKton, the Southampton Hackerspace project. 

We are a community of makers, tinkerers and artists. Our aim is to share
skills and tools to allow anyone to create something amazing, regardless
of experience. We want to start a [Hackerspace][] in Southampton, where
people can come to work on their various projects and can get the
resources they need and can share knowledge and ideas. *If you always
wanted to make something but don't know how then our members will be
more than happy to help you.*

We have regular meetings of people who enjoy creating or modifying
software and/or hardware and want to meet other like-minded people.
Ultimately our aim is to support all sorts of interests, for example:
craft, electronics, wood- and metal-work, knitting, programming,
modification (a.k.a. hacking), robotics and home automation. Experience
is unnecessary - interest is all we require! 

Topics that our existing members are interested in include:

  * home automation/augmentation
  * robotics
  * circuit bends
  * programming
  * computer interfaces
  * wiimote hacking
  * Arduino
  * gadgets
  * mobile computing
  * PVR creation/improvement
  * programming
  * augmented reality
  * and much more

If youâ€™re interested in any of these topics, or have another interest
you want to share, why not join us?

We are currently holding a meeting the last Thursday of every month at
the Arthouse Cafe in Southampton:
