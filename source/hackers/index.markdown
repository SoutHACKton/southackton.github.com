[Hackers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_\(hobbyist\) "Wikipedia Hacker \(hobbyist\) article")
are people who modify the software or hardware of their computer system
including building, rebuilding, modifying and creating software and
electronic hardware either to make it better, faster, give added
features or to make it do something it was never intended to do.

[Crackers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_\(computer_security\)#Black_hat "Crackers are Black Hat Hackers")
are people who illegally break in to computer systems. 

This site is
targetted at hobbyist hackers - people who just want to make technology
do cool stuff, often stuff it was never intended to do (such as turning
on a light using a Wii remote...)
