  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>SoutHACKton is a not-for-profit community of makers, tinkerers and
  artists. We have regular meetings - experience is unnecessary! <a
    href="/about/">Find out more</a> or join our <a
    href="http://groups.google.com/group/SoutHACKton/">mailing list</a>.</p>

  <p>Our aim is to establish and maintain a well-equiped space where
  members can share skills and tools to allow people of all abilities to create
  something amazing, regardless of experience, whether it be: craft,
  electronics, wood- and metal-work, knitting, programming, modification
  (a.k.a. hacking), robotics, home automation or something else. </p>
