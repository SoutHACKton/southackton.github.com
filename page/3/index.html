  <div class="entry-content"><p>We had about 15 people show up at the Arthouse, with talk of Arduinos,
3D printers, teardowns and mobiles. Tea was drunk, cakes were eaten and
a good time was apparently had by all.</p>

<p>Teardowns:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to the powerful organisational skills of Phased / Ben we&#8217;ll be
taming up with the local Dorkbot group to have a big meetup at the
Arthouse Cafe in Southampton.</p>

<blockquote><p>Makers, hackers, tinkerers. Lend me your microphones :O) &#8230;</p>

<p>Following
much consultation, the next Southackton meeting shall be 9th March at
Art House Southampton. Aim is to start at 7.30pm.</p>

<p>We will unite with
the Dorkbots, sharing their March meeting, to create a union of Dorks
and Hackers, possibly for one night only but hopefully a continuing
unity will emerge in the form of Harks or Dockers :O)</p>

<p>Please try to
get there a little early, to have time to grab coffees and cakes, as
that will be the primary method of funding the &#8220;hire&#8221; of the venue /
it&#8217;s continued existence.</p>

<p>As suggested, it will be a combined Duino
and Teardown
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3">http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/bfff4bf5e88785a3</a>
event.</p>

<p>Please bring along anything you have created using the Duino
platforms and anything you fancy Tearing Down.</p>

<p>Please feel free to
share designs / code / links for your Duino creations on our Google
group beforehand, so those attending have an opportunity to discuss
more deeply during the event.</p>

<p>We will aim to leave a 15-20 minute
period near the end for sharing of your unwanted bits from the
Teardowns and discussion on future plans for Southackton.</p>

<p>Look forward
to seeing you all there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week&#8217;s workshop was great fun despite the dreary weather!
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman" title="Mitch Altman on Wikipedia">Mitch Altman</a>,
(inventor of TV-B-Gone, and co-founder of
<a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noisebridge" title="Noisebridge  hackerspace">Noisebridge</a>)
and <a href="http://jimmieprodgers.com/">Jimmie P Rodgers</a> (circuit bender and

<a href="http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/openheart/">LED hearts</a> and
<a href="http://jimmieprodgers.com/kits/lolshield/">LoL shields</a>) joined us at
SteamShift HQ in Eastleigh to put on a workshop excitingly titled &#8220;How
To Make Cool Things with Microcontrollers!&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="http://theuncommon.co.uk/hackspace/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/photo-300x225.jpg" width="300" title="Mitch Altman teaching soldering" ></p>

<p>Mitch gave a great introduction to microcontrollers, and entertained
everyone with, among other tales, his experiences in the US, recounting
how he left his job in Silicone Valley and got into hardware hacking,
and amusingly how the Noisebridge hackerspace is insured somewhere under
the category of &#8220;Artistic Robotics&#8221;.</p>

<p>He and Jimmy had a great selection
of projects on show and available as kits for hacking; the LoL Shields
went down well, around 6 of us opted to build them for our arduinos.</p>

<p><img src="http://img705.yfrog.com/img705/3484/2t9.jpg" title="Soldering at Southackton" ></p>

<p>Another attendee constructed an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Punk_Console">Atari Punk Console</a>, while someone
else constructed their first arduino clone from a
<a href="http://www.ladyada.net/make/boarduino/">Boarduino kit</a>.</p>

<p>Our guests continued their
tour of the UK the following day, going on to their
<a href="http://buildbrighton.eventwax.com/elecrtonics-workshop-with-mitch-altman">next event</a>
at the
<a href="http://www.buildbrighton.com/">Brighton hackerspace BuildBrighton</a>.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested in
hardware hacking or learning to solder, why not join the discussions on
our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/">google group</a>? If you
want to stay up to date with the latest SoutHACKton news the

<p><em>This is the beginning of a post from
<a href="http://www.benjiegillam.com/" title="Benjie">about:benjie</a>. If you&#8217;ve written
a blog post you think would be useful to SoutHACKton members, please get
in touch!</em></p>

<p>I’m working on a new project, I’ve got a
<a href="http://www.earthshinedesign.co.uk/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=38_43&amp;product_id=82" title="8x8 dual colour dot matrix display">8×8 dual colour dot matrix display</a>
(£2.50 delivered from Earthshine Design) and I want to power it from the
<a href="http://www.arduino.cc" title="Arduino">Arduino</a>. One way of making a chip
like that (which has 2×8x8 = 128
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode" title="Light-emitting diode">LEDs</a>)
would be to have a common ground and an additional 128 pins – one for
each LED. This, I think you’d agree, would be a nightmare, so instead
they’ve basically gone for an 8×16 grid for a total of 24 pins. This
raises two main problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can’t turn 2 arbitrary LEDs on at the same time unless they are
on the same row/column. (Doing so would actually draw a square of
LEDs.)</li>
<li>My Arduino doesn’t have enough digital input/output pins</li>
</ol>


<p>Point 1 is easily solved – we simply update just one row at a time,
letting
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision">Persistance Of Vision</a> (POV) do the
hard work for us. Point 2 is the subject of this post –
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing" title="Multiplexing">multiplexing</a>,
combining multiple individual signals into just one signal. I will not
be using this dot matrix display in this post, instead I will simply be
powering normal LEDs. I wanted to find out if the Arduino is fast enough
to multiplex the data through just a few pins in order to power this
display. The answer (one of my favourite answers!) is: “Yes, but not

<h2>Sunday 4th October 2009, 10:30am-6:30pm,</h2>

<p><a href="http://steamshift.net/" title="Steamshift">Steamshift</a> HQ</p>

<p>As
<a href="http://www.southackton.org.uk/2009/09/review-of-the-arduino-meet/" title="Review of the Arduino Meet">the Arduino meeting</a>
was such a success, we&#8217;ve already booked our next meetup - a Hack Day -
again kindly hosted by Steamshift at
<a href="http://steamshift.net/page/contact" title="Steamshift HQ">their HQ in Eastleigh</a>.</p>

<h3>What is a Hack Day?</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s a day where everyone brings along their current projects (if any)
and can work on them in the presence of other like-minded individuals.
Just starting out with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/" title="Arduino">Arduino</a>?
Putting the finishing touches on your latest life-size robot? Planning
to build a water jet-pack? Hacking electronics into clothing? Hacking
together the components necessary to make a new GNU/Linux distro or
media centre software? Join us!</p>

<h3>What if I don&#8217;t have a current project?</h3>

<p>Come along anyway - help with someone else&#8217;s! Skilled or unskilled,
knowledgeable or not-so-knowledgeable, all are welcome!</p>

<h3>Why is it so long?</h3>

<p>The idea is that people can turn up when they want for however long they
want - pop in for just a couple of hours or come for the whole day -
it&#8217;s completely up to you! We anticipate that the busiest time will be
12:30 until 4:30.</p>

<h3>Why so early? (Also: what about lunch?)</h3>

<p>We thought it would be nice to have lunch together (at around 1pm,
though the timing is up to the individual) - some of us will probably
order pizza, others may bring lunch with them. However, we didn&#8217;t want
to cut into two meal times so we&#8217;ve aimed for &#8220;after breakfast and
before dinner.&#8221; :) Everyone is responsible for bringing/ordering their
own food and drink.</p>

<h3>Where do I sign up?</h3>

<p>This will be another free (no cost) day, all you need to do is turn up.
We like to know how many people are coming though, so please join the
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton" title="SoutHACKton Google Group">Google Group</a>
and drop a short message in
t<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/southackton/browse_thread/thread/8cacb10d7087a8ac">this hread</a>.</p>

<p>Looking forward to seeing you there!</p>

<p>This event is kindly hosted by Steamshift.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Our next meeting, Hack Day 1, is on 4th October.
<a href="http://www.southackton.org.uk/2009/09/hack-day-1-meetup/" title="Hack Day 1">Click here</a>
for details.</em></p>

<p>At 2pm Saturday 29th of August, on an otherwise uneventful
bank holiday weekend, a varied group of men and women met at
<a href="http://steamshift.net/">Steamshift</a> HQ. Their purpose - to get down to
business and HACK! Some arrived with projects in mind - disco lights,
energy usage monitoring, laser mazes - while others turned up with
little equipment but an eagerness to get their hands dirty. At the full
height of the meet, there were around twenty people there, playing
around with <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a> and
<a href="http://www.rev-ed.co.uk/picaxe/">PIXACE</a> boards.</p>

<p><img src="http://theuncommon.co.uk/hackspace/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sothackton2.jpg" alt="Southackton Meet" /></p>

<p>The meet was organised and hosted by
<a href="http://twitter.com/steamshift" title="@steamshift">Andy Bennett</a> and Steamshift as
part of SoutHACKton - a group of like-minded Solent residents who all
want to kick back, take stuff apart and build new things out of the
resulting mess.</p>

<p><a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3660/3874748845_6c40e25cef_m.jpg"><img src="http://theuncommon.co.uk/hackspace/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sothackton3.jpg" alt="Southackton Meet" /></a></p>

<p>And that they did - sometimes clusterd in small groups, working away on
personal projects, sometimes coming together in larger groups to admire
a piece of someone else&#8217;s handy work. Projects that drew particular
attention were Ruzz&#8217;s walking robots (a hit at our last meet too),
<a href="http://twitter.com/fraz3alpha" title="@fraz3alpha">Andy T</a>&#8217;s LEDs (Did I mention he
has 4,000 LEDs?) and my own project: Lou Lou the Furby. I hope to hook
Lou Lou up to the PC and tell me when I get new email. Maybe she&#8217;ll get
her <a href="http://twitter.com/Bubblino" title="Bubblino">own twitter account</a> one
day. For now, she&#8217;ll just have to be happy playing sounds from my eeePC
through an Arduino.</p>
